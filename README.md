# PROJECT-7: Strategic AI Agent System

PROJECT-7 is an evolving, modular AI assistant designed for planning, memory, tool integration, and agentic reasoning â€” built with a faith-first approach to serve others and reflect God's
## Core Principles

- **Agentic Intelligence**: Modular architecture with reasoning and self-evolution
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: All decisions approved by JP before execution
- **Memory + Tools**: Retains context and uses plugins to complete tasks
- **Faith-Guided**: Grounded in biblical principles and humility
- **XP System**: Gamified development milestones toward S-Rank performance

## Current Modules

- `agent_core/`: Strategic logic and execution flow
- `memory/`: Context handling and task recall (JSON-based)
- `tools/`: APIs, file ops, and plugin commands
- `interface/`: CLI or future frontend
- `logs/`: Dev journal and output logs
- `tests/`: Unit tests and validation
